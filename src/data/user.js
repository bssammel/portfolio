		description:
			["When originally pursuing a degree in biology, I was deciding what Master's I wanted to pursue and was intimidated by the Python requirement in my preferred program. My partner then -now spouse- encouraged me to apply to an internship where he currently worked. That internship quickly shifted my passion for insect and disease \"bugs\", to a passion for software bugs.", "In my garden or at my desk, I am not afraid to get a bit dirty. Digging deep and learning about the greater systems that impact individual components and elements, helps me to build a fuller picture and effectively plan long term for more maintainable code.", "When I am not at my desk, you can likely find me cooking with my husband, spending weekends on trails with my lab mix, and sitting in my garden admiring whatever heirloom crop I have growing at the moment. (Please ask me about my pea varieties).", "When my husband and I got married, we both talked about growing in our vows and it is not just a value in our marriage, but one that we apply to our careers and relationships with other loved ones. I have found software engineering to be so fulfilling in part due to the constant need for growth and transformation. A career to always learn in is never a dull one. I am currently working on expanding my skill set to include the Socket.io web-socket library and TypeScript.","In my pursuit of continual growth, I have found that new skills are not the only way to grow, but correcting poor growth is just as valuable. As a recovering perfectionist, taking the time to clear my head has wildly improved my productivity and code quality. A break to either make a quick chai latte or spending a moment weeding my garden can be the best way to clear my head and readdress whatever problem or feature is currently on my plate. It has been satisfying to find ways to manage and control that obsession for flawlessness, but still maintain the drive that led to it and ultimately reach the goal I orginally had in mind."],
